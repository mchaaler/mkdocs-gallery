Do you love Sphinx-Gallery but prefer mkdocs over Sphinx for your documentation ? mkdocs-gallery was written for you ;) It relies on mkdocs-material to get the most of mkdocs, so that your galleries look nice ! Installing \u00b6 > pip install mkdocs-gallery Usage \u00b6 1. Create a source gallery folder \u00b6 First, create a folder that will contain your gallery examples, for example docs/examples/ . It will be referenced by the examples_dirs configuration option . Then in this folder, you may add a readme. This readme should be written in markdown, be named README or readme or Readme , and have a .md or .txt extension. Note: the folder can be located inside the usual mkdocs source folder: docs/ # base mkdocs source directory \u2514\u2500\u2500 examples/ # base 'Gallery of Examples' directory \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md or not examples/ # base 'Gallery of Examples' directory \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md docs/ # base mkdocs source directory 2. Configure mkdocs \u00b6 a. Basics \u00b6 Simply add the following configuration to you mkdocs.yml : theme : material # This theme is mandatory for now, see below plugins : - gallery : examples_dirs : docs/examples # path to your example scripts gallery_dirs : docs/generated/gallery # where to save generated gallery # ... (other options) - search # make sure the search plugin is still enabled Most sphinx-gallery configuration options are supported and can be configured in here after examples_dirs and gallery_dirs . All paths should be relative to the mkdocs.yml file. You can look at the configuration used to generate this site as an example: mkdocs.yml . Caution mkdocs-gallery currently requires that you use the material theme from mkdocs-material to render properly. You may wish to try other themes to see what is missing to support them: actually, only a few things concerning buttons and icons do not seem to currently work properly. Note The search plugin is not related with mkdocs-gallery. It is activated by default in mkdocs but if you edit the plugins configuration you have to add it explicitly again. Once you've done this, the corresponding gallery will be created the next time you call mkdocs build or mkdocs serve . However the gallery will not yet appear in the table of contents (mkdocs nav ). For this you should add the generated gallery to the nav in mkdocs.yml : nav : - Home : index.md - generated/gallery # This node will automatically be named and have sub-nodes. When the root folder or the root index.md of a gallery is added to the nav, it will be automatically populated with sub-nodes for all examples and subgalleries. If you prefer to select examples or subgalleries to include one by one, you may refer to any of them directly in the nav. In that case, no nav automation will be performed - just the usual explicit mkdocs nav. You may wish to change the gallery's names for display and still benefit from this automation: nav : - Home : index.md - My Gallery : generated/gallery # This node will automatically be named and have sub-nodes. See this site's config for an example. See also mkdocs configuration for general information about the mkdocs.yml file. b. Advanced \u00b6 You may wish to use the special conf_script option to create the base configuration using a python script, like what was done in Sphinx-gallery: plugins : - gallery : conf_script : docs/gallery_conf.py # ... other options can still be added here The python script should be executable without error, and at the end of execution should contain a conf variable defined at the module level. For example this is a valid script: from mkdocs_gallery.gen_gallery import DefaultResetArgv conf = { 'reset_argv' : DefaultResetArgv (), } You can set options both in the script and in the yaml. In case of duplicates, the yaml options override the script-defined ones. 3. Add gallery examples \u00b6 Gallery examples are structured the same way as in sphinx-gallery , with two major differences: All comment blocks should be written using Markdown instead of rST. No sphinx directive is supported: all markdown directives should be supported by mkdocs , by one of its activated plugins or by a base markdown extension (see note below). examples/ # base 'Gallery of Examples' directory \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 <.py files> \u2514\u2500\u2500 subgallery_1/ # generates the 'No image output examples' sub-gallery \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u2514\u2500\u2500 <.py files> 4. Examples \u00b6 The entire original gallery of examples from sphinx-gallery is being ported here (work in progress). You may wish to check it out in order to see how each technical aspect translates in the mkdocs world. You can look at the configuration used to generate it here: mkdocs.yml . 5. Feature Highlights \u00b6 a. Mkdocs \"serve\" mode \u00b6 mkdocs-gallery supports the mkdocs dev-server mkdocs serve so that you can edit your gallery examples with live auto-rebuild (similar to sphinx-autobuild). As soon as you modify an example file, it will rebuild the documentation and notify your browser. The examples that did not change will be automatically skipped (based on md5, identical to sphinx-gallery). See mkdocs documentation for details. b. Editing Examples \u00b6 All mkdocs-gallery generated pages have a working \"edit page\" pencil icon at the top, including gallery summary (readme) pages. This link will take you directly to the source file for easy pull requests on gallery examples ! c. Binder \u00b6 Binder configuration is slightly easier than the one in sphinx-gallery (as of version 1.0.1), as 2 pieces of config are now optional: branch (defaults to \"gh-pages\" ) binderhub_url (defaults to \"https://mybinder.org\" ) 6. Make your examples shine ! \u00b6 The following mkdocs plugins and extensions are automatically activated - you may therefore use them in your markdown blocks without changing your mkdocs.yml configuration: mkdocs-material mkdocs plugin: make sure you check this one out ! navigation.indexes in the material theme. This is used for the gallery readme pages to be selectible in the nav without creating an extra entry (see left pane). icons + emojis All no-conf features are there too, for example support for \\(\\LaTeX\\) using Mathjax , code blocks , Admonitions etc. markdown extensions: attr_list to declare attributes such as css classes on markdown elements. admonition used to add notes. pymdownx.details to create foldable notes such as this one. pymdownx.highlight pymdownx.inlinehilite pymdownx.superfences pymdownx.snippets pymdownx.emoji configured with the catalog from mkdocs-material (see above) See Also \u00b6 sphinx-gallery mkdocs mkdocs-material PyMdown Extensions Others \u00b6 Do you like this library ?

It would be useful to compare the source Python file with the output below. Source files for gallery examples should start with a triple-quoted header docstring. Anything before the docstring is ignored by Mkdocs-Gallery and will not appear in the rendered output, nor will it be executed. This docstring requires a Markdown header, which is used as the title of the example and to correctly build cross-referencing links. Code and embedded Markdown text blocks follow the docstring. The first block immediately after the docstring is deemed a code block, by default, unless you specify it to be a text block using a line of # 's or #%% (see below). All code blocks get executed by Mkdocs-Gallery and any output, including plots will be captured. Typically, code and text blocks are interspersed to provide narrative explanations of what the code is doing or interpretations of code output. Mathematical expressions can be included as LaTeX, and will be rendered with MathJax. See mkdocs-material for configuration of your mkdocs.yml as well as for syntax details. For example, we are about to plot the following function: \\[ x \\rightarrow \\sin(x) \\] Here the function \\(\\sin\\) is evaluated at each point the variable \\(x\\) is defined. When including LaTeX in a Python string, ensure that you escape the backslashes or use a raw docstring. You do not need to do this in text blocks (see below). import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np . linspace ( 0 , 2 * np . pi , 100 ) y = np . sin ( x ) plt . plot ( x , y ) plt . xlabel ( r '$x$' ) plt . ylabel ( r '$\\sin(x)$' ) # To avoid matplotlib text output plt . show () To include embedded Markdown, use a line of >= 20 # 's or #%% between your Markdown and your code (see syntax ). This separates your example into distinct text and code blocks. You can continue writing code below the embedded Markdown text block: print ( 'This example shows a sin plot!' ) Out: This example shows a sin plot! LaTeX syntax in the text blocks does not require backslashes to be escaped: \\[ \\sin \\] Cross referencing \u00b6 You can refer to an example from any part of the documentation, including from other examples. However as opposed to what happens in Sphinx, there is no possibility to create unique identifiers in MkDocs. So you should use relative paths. First, let's note that the markdown for the current file is located at docs/generated/gallery/plot_1_sin.md . This is because the configuration for this gallery in mkdocs.yml states that the examples/ gallery should be generated in the generated/gallery folder. Below, the example we want to cross-reference is the 'SyntaxError' example, located in the no_output subgallery of the examples gallery. The associated generated file is docs/generated/gallery/no_output/plot_syntaxerror.md . docs/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 generated/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 gallery/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 no_output/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 plot_syntaxerror.md # example to reference \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 plot_1_sin.md # current example \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... We can therefore cross-link to the example using [SyntaxError](./no_output/plot_syntaxerror.md) : SyntaxError . Of course as for normal documents, we can leverage plugins (e.g. mkdocs-material) and extensions. So here we use admonitions : to create a nice \"see also\" note: See also See SyntaxError for an example with an error.

Below, the example we want to cross-reference is the 'SyntaxError' example, located in the no_output subgallery of the examples gallery. The associated generated file is docs/generated/gallery/no_output/plot_syntaxerror.md . docs/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 generated/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 gallery/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 no_output/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 plot_syntaxerror.md # example to reference \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 plot_1_sin.md # current example \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... We can therefore cross-link to the example using [SyntaxError](./no_output/plot_syntaxerror.md) : SyntaxError . Of course as for normal documents, we can leverage plugins (e.g. mkdocs-material) and extensions. So here we use admonitions : to create a nice \"see also\" note: See also See SyntaxError for an example with an error.

The default capture_repr setting is ('_repr_html_', '__repr__') and was used to build this Mkdocs-Gallery documentation. The output that is captured with this setting is demonstrated in this example. Differences in outputs that would be captured with other capture_repr settings are also explained. Nothing is captured for the code block below because no data is directed to standard output and the last statement is an assignment, not an expression. # example 1 a = 2 b = 10 If you did wish to capture the value of b , you would need to use: # example 2 a = 2 b = 10 b # this is an expression Out: 10 Mkdocs-Gallery first attempts to capture the _repr_html_ of b as this is the first 'representation' method in the capture_repr tuple. As this method does not exist for b , Mkdocs-Gallery moves on and tries to capture the __repr__ method, which is second in the tuple. This does exist for b so it is captured and the output is seen above. A pandas dataframe is used in the code block below to provide an example of an expression with a _repr_html_ method. # example 3 import pandas as pd df = pd . DataFrame ( data = { 'col1' : [ 1 , 2 ], 'col2' : [ 3 , 4 ]}) df .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } col1 col2 0 1 3 1 2 4 The pandas dataframe df has both a __repr__ and _repr_html_ method. As _repr_html_ appears first in the capture_repr tuple, the _repr_html_ is captured in preference to __repr__ . Statsmodels tables should also be styled appropriately: # example 4 import numpy as np import statsmodels.iolib.table statsmodels . iolib . table . SimpleTable ( np . zeros (( 3 , 3 ))) 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 For the example below, there is data directed to standard output and the last statement is an expression. # example 5 print ( 'Hello world' ) a + b Out: Hello world 12 print() outputs to standard output, which is always captured. The string 'Hello world' is thus captured. A 'representation' of the last expression is also captured. Again, since this expression a + b does not have a _repr_html_ method, the __repr__ method is captured. Matplotlib output \u00b6 Matplotlib function calls generally return a Matplotlib object as well as outputting the figure. For code blocks where the last statement is a Matplotlib expression, a 'representation' of the object will be captured, as well as the plot. This is because Matplotlib objects have a __repr__ method and our capture_repr tuple contains __repr__ . Note that Matplotlib objects also have a __str__ method. In the example below, matplotlib.pyplot.plot() returns a list of Line2D objects representing the plotted data and the __repr__ of the list is captured as well as the figure: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt . plot ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) Out: [ <matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x7fd4d2a1d790> ] To avoid capturing the text representation, you can assign the last Matplotlib expression to a temporary variable: _ = plt . plot ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) Alternatively, you can add plt.show() , which does not return anything, to the end of the code block: plt . plot ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) plt . show () The capture_repr configuration \u00b6 The capture_repr configuration is ('_repr_html_', '__repr__') by default. This directs Mkdocs-Gallery to capture 'representations' of the last statement of a code block, if it is an expression. Mkdocs-Gallery does this according to the order 'representations' appear in the tuple. With the default capture_repr setting, _repr_html_ is attempted to be captured first. If this method does not exist, the __repr__ method would be captured. If the __repr__ also does not exist (unlikely for non-user defined objects), nothing would be captured. For example, if the the configuration was set to 'capture_repr': ('_repr_html_') nothing would be captured for example 2 as b does not have a _repr_html_ . You can change the 'representations' in the capture_repr tuple to finely tune what is captured in your example .py files. To only capture data directed to standard output you can set capture_repr to be an empty tuple: capture_repr: () . With this setting, only data directed to standard output is captured. For the examples above, output would only be captured for example 4. Although the last statement is an expression for examples 2, 3 and 4 no 'representation' of the last expression would be output. You would need to add print() to the last expression to capture a 'representation' of it.
